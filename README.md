# Bacterial run-tumble motion in a 2D Lorentz gas environment
This repository contains code to run simulations in MATLAB, as reported in XXX.

A bacterium is represented as a point particle undergoing run-and-tumble motion. It navigates an environment consisting of randomly-placed, overlapping, hard circles in two dimensions. When the cell encounters an obstacle, it slides along the surface, with the component of its velocity along the surface normal vector set to zero. At the intersection of two obstacles, it gets stuck.
